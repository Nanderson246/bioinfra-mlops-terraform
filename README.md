# 🌍 Bioinfra MLOps Mini Project — Terraform + MLflow + Multi-Cloud

This is a **portfolio-ready mini-project** that demonstrates how to build a complete **machine learning pipeline** using:

- 🧱 Infrastructure-as-Code with **Terraform**
- 🤖 ML model training + tracking with **scikit-learn** and **MLflow**
- ☁️ Multi-platform deployment: **AWS**, **GCP**, **Azure**, **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **HPC**, and **GitHub**

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

To serve as a **portfolio-ready example** that shows:

- 🔧 Provisioning infrastructure using **Terraform**
- 🤖 Training and saving a real ML model using **Python, scikit-learn, and MLflow**
- 📊 Logging metrics and managing model versions via **MLflow**
- 🐳 Containerizing the workflow with **Docker**
- ☁️ Demonstrating multi-cloud portability using consistent ML logic

## 🧠 What's Inside the `ml_model/` Folder?

| File                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `train.py`          | Trains a RandomForestClassifier on a real breast cancer dataset (from sklearn), logs to MLflow. |
| `mlflow_tracking.py`| (Optional) Module for decoupled logging logic. |
| `model.pkl`         | Trained model saved locally for serving (e.g. Flask API). |
| `requirements.txt`  | Python dependencies for training and tracking. |

---

## 📘 High-Level Workflow Steps

### 🛠️ 1. Setup

- Install Terraform and AWS CLI (instructions below)
- Configure cloud credentials (e.g., AWS `~/.aws/credentials`)

### 🚀 2. Deploy Infrastructure (e.g., AWS)

```bash
cd terraform/aws_compute
terraform init
terraform apply
````

### 🖥️ 3. SSH into the Instance

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@<instance_ip>
```

### 📦 4. Run the ML Pipeline

```bash
cd ml_model
python3 train.py
```

### 🐳 5. (Optional) Run Docker App

```bash
docker build -t mlapp ../docker
docker run -p 5000:5000 mlapp
```

## 📈 ML Model: Breast Cancer Classifier

We use:

* **Dataset**: `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`
* **Model**: `RandomForestClassifier`
* **Metric**: Accuracy
* **Tracking**: MLflow to `mlruns/`

---

## 📦 MLflow Tracking

* All training runs are automatically tracked.
* Experiments are grouped under `BioinfraML`.
* To launch the UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Then open your browser at: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🧰 AWS CLI & Terraform Install (Linux)

### Terraform:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
terraform -version
```

### AWS CLI:

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
aws --version
```
