### 📦 `terraform/gcp_pipeline/README.md`

## 📍 Purpose

This folder contains Terraform code to deploy a virtual machine on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, specifically to run bioinformatics or machine learning workflows.

> ✅ **GCP = Google Cloud Platform**
> A suite of cloud services provided by Google, including compute, storage, networking, and AI tools — similar to AWS or Azure.

This module focuses on using GCP's **Compute Engine** to launch a Linux VM where you can run code, pipelines, or containers.

---

## 📦 What It Deploys

* A **virtual machine instance** (VM) in a GCP region and zone of your choice
* Basic setup with Python, Docker, and ML tools via startup script
* Network access for SSH
* Outputs the machine’s external IP

---

## 📁 Files

* `main.tf` – Defines the VM and its config
* `variables.tf` – Inputs like project, region, zone, VM size
* `outputs.tf` – Shows IP of the deployed instance after provisioning

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Authenticate with GCP

You must have the Google Cloud CLI installed.

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project your-gcp-project-id
```

You can also create and use a service account JSON key with:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/key.json"
```

---

### 2. Deploy with Terraform

```bash
cd terraform/gcp_pipeline
terraform init
terraform apply
```

---

### 3. Connect to the Instance

```bash
ssh -i your-private-key username@<external_ip>
```

---

## 🔐 Requirements

* A GCP account with billing enabled
* A valid project and region/zone
* GCP CLI (`gcloud`) installed and authenticated
* Terraform CLI installed
* SSH keypair (manually or generated by Terraform)

---

## 🧠 Why Use GCP?

* Popular in research, academic, and genomics projects
* Cost-effective preemptible VMs available
* Strong AI/ML ecosystem (TPUs, Vertex AI)
* Easy integration with Jupyter, GCS (Google Cloud Storage), and more
