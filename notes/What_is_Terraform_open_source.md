Terraform 

## 🧪 1. Terraform Open Source (CLI tool)
💻 Free to use

Run locally or in CI/CD

Define .tf files and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform init
terraform apply
Supports all providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, GitHub, etc.)

Perfect for individuals, students, or small teams.



## 📁 Terraform Project Structure — Clean and Real

Terraform projects are made of `.tf` files that define your infrastructure. Here’s how they’re structured **logically**:

```
project-folder/
├── main.tf           # Core resources (VMs, disks, networks, etc.)
├── variables.tf      # All input variables used in main.tf
├── outputs.tf        # Values Terraform prints after deploy (e.g. IPs)
├── terraform.tfvars  # (Optional) Values for your variables
├── provider.tf       # (Optional) Cloud provider config (can be in main.tf)
```

---

## ✅ What Each File Does

### `main.tf`

> This is your **blueprint**: the VMs, disks, firewalls, networks, etc.

Example:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm" {
  name         = var.instance_name
  machine_type = var.machine_type
  zone         = var.zone

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"
    }
  }

  network_interface {
    network       = "default"
    access_config {}
  }

  metadata_startup_script = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    apt update
    apt install -y python3-pip git docker.io
    pip3 install pandas scikit-learn mlflow
  EOF
}
```

---

### `variables.tf`

> This defines **what inputs** your setup expects.

Example:

```hcl
variable "project" {
  type    = string
  default = "your-gcp-project-id"
}

variable "region" {
  default = "us-central1"
}

variable "zone" {
  default = "us-central1-a"
}

variable "instance_name" {
  default = "bio-vm"
}

variable "machine_type" {
  default = "e2-medium"
}
```

---

### `outputs.tf`

> This defines **what Terraform prints out** after the deploy — useful info like the VM IP.

Example:

```hcl
output "vm_ip" {
  value = google_compute_instance.vm.network_interface[0].access_config[0].nat_ip
}
```

---

### `terraform.tfvars` (optional)

> Set your variable values **here** if you don’t want to type them at the command line.

Example:

```hcl
project       = "your-gcp-project-id"
region        = "us-central1"
zone          = "us-central1-a"
instance_name = "bio-vm"
machine_type  = "e2-medium"
```

---

### `provider.tf` (optional)

> Sometimes people separate the provider block:

```hcl
provider "google" {
  project = var.project
  region  = var.region
}
```

You can also include this directly in `main.tf`. It doesn’t matter — Terraform loads all `.tf` files in the folder.

---

## 🧠 So What Happens When You Run Terraform?

```bash
terraform init      # sets up backend and providers
terraform plan      # previews what will be created
terraform apply     # builds the infrastructure
```

---

## TL;DR

| File               | What It Does                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.tf`          | Defines **what gets created** (VMs, networks, etc.) |
| `variables.tf`     | Defines **inputs** that you can reuse or override   |
| `outputs.tf`       | Defines **what you see after it runs**              |
| `terraform.tfvars` | Optional — values for variables                     |
| `provider.tf`      | Optional — config for your cloud provider           |

---

If you still have fuel left and want a clean GCP version to run, I’ll build that next — but this time with you steering. No pet project BS. Just clear infra code.


YES — you've got it exactly. Let me clarify and confirm every part of what you're saying:

---

## ✅ What Each Variable Represents in `terraform.tfvars`

Let’s say you have this in your `variables.tf`:

```hcl
variable "project" {
  type = string
}

variable "region" {
  type = string
}

variable "zone" {
  type = string
}

variable "machine_type" {
  type = string
}

variable "instance_name" {
  type = string
}
```

Then your `terraform.tfvars` might look like this:

```hcl
project       = "my-gcp-project-id"        # 🔐 GCP project you're billing to
region        = "us-central1"              # 🌍 Region (like where in the world)
zone          = "us-central1-a"            # 🏢 Data center zone inside that region
machine_type  = "e2-standard-4"            # ⚙️ Type of VM (like CPUs/memory)
instance_name = "bio-vm"                   # 🖥️ The name you assign to your machine
```

---

### 🔍 Breakdown of What You Said:

> “The tfvars where the server is…”

✅ Correct — `region` and `zone` define **where the server runs** (physically, like "Iowa" or "Germany").

---

> “…the type of service…”

✅ Correct — `machine_type` defines **how powerful the server is**, like:

* `e2-micro` (very light)
* `e2-standard-4` (4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM)
* `n2-highmem-8` (big, RAM-heavy)

---

> “…and the instance is my name instance bio-vm…”

✅ Also correct — `instance_name = "bio-vm"` is just your **label for the server**. It could be anything:

* `"rna-aligner"`
* `"nf-core-runner"`
* `"hpc-test-node"`

This name is what will show up in your GCP console when the VM launches.

## 🧠 Summary

| Variable        | Meaning                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `project`       | Your GCP billing project ID                      |
| `region`        | Where in the world the server is                 |
| `zone`          | The specific data center rack                    |
| `machine_type`  | The power and size of the VM                     |
| `instance_name` | What you want to name the machine (just a label) |

## 🔍 Terraform Variables — Plain and Precise

### 🗂 Where they live:

* `variables.tf` — defines the variables (types, descriptions)
* `terraform.tfvars` — sets the actual values

---

### 🧾 What each variable means:

| Variable Name   | Purpose                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project`       | The GCP project where your resources will be billed and created     |
| `region`        | Broad location of your resources (e.g., `us-central1` = Iowa)       |
| `zone`          | Specific rack/data center inside the region (e.g., `us-central1-a`) |
| `machine_type`  | The “size” of your virtual machine (CPU + RAM)                      |
| `instance_name` | A name *you choose* for your VM — just a label                      |

---

### 📁 Example: `terraform.tfvars`

```hcl
project       = "bioinformatics-lab-123"
region        = "us-central1"
zone          = "us-central1-a"
machine_type  = "e2-standard-4"
instance_name = "bio-vm"
```

This tells Terraform:

> “Launch a VM in my project `bioinformatics-lab-123`, in Google’s Iowa data center, using a standard-4 machine, and name it `bio-vm`.”

---

## ✅ Your Only Job Is to Set Values in `terraform.tfvars`

You **don’t need to touch `main.tf`** except to reference the variable names like `var.zone`, `var.machine_type`, etc.

Everything flows from `terraform.tfvars` into your infrastructure — clean and controlled.

---

## ✅ You Have Two Ways to Install Tools

### 1. **Install via Terraform (`user_data`, metadata startup scripts)**

🔧 Happens **automatically** when the VM boots.
✅ Good for: installing Python, Docker, MLflow, etc.

```hcl
metadata_startup_script = <<-EOF
  #!/bin/bash
  apt update
  apt install -y python3-pip docker.io
  pip3 install mlflow scikit-learn
EOF
```

But:

* 🛠️ Harder to debug
* 📦 You’re limited to what can be done at boot time

---

### 2. **Install tools manually after SSH into the VM**

After `terraform apply` finishes, you can:

```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>
```

Then install **anything**:

```bash
sudo apt install fastqc
pip install nextflow
docker pull mlflow/mlflow
```

✅ More flexible
✅ Better for experimentation
🚫 But it’s not reproducible unless you script or document it

---

## 💡 Best Practice for Projects

| Setup Method       | Use When...                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_data` script | You want **fast, automated, repeatable** environments |
| Manual (SSH)       | You're exploring, troubleshooting, or setting up once |
| Dockerfile         | You're containerizing a fixed toolchain               |
| Configuration mgmt | (like Ansible, Packer) for large/complex systems      |

---

## 🧠 

* ✅ You can always SSH in and install tools manually
* ✅ You can also automate installs through Terraform at boot time
