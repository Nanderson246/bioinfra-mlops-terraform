üîç What is model.pkl?
It's a pickled version of your trained model, saved using joblib.dump():

python
Copy
Edit
joblib.dump(model, "model.pkl")
This creates a file you can:

Reuse later without retraining the model

Load in another Python script (like an API or notebook)

Package into a Docker container for serving

Deploy in cloud services or REST endpoints

üß† Why save it separately (besides MLflow)?
Even though you already logged the model to MLflow, saving model.pkl:

‚úÖ Makes local development faster ‚Äî just joblib.load("model.pkl") to use it again.

‚úÖ Enables easy REST API deployment (like Flask or FastAPI).

‚úÖ Lets you decouple training from inference ‚Äî train once, reuse many times.

‚úÖ Example: How you'd use model.pkl later
python
Copy
Edit
import joblib

model = joblib.load("model.pkl")
pred = model.predict([[1, 0]])
print(pred)
Or in your app.py (Flask):

python
Copy
Edit
model = joblib.load("model.pkl")

@app.route("/predict", methods=["POST"])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    features = [[data['A'], data['B']]]
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    return {"prediction": int(prediction[0])}
üöÄ Summary
File	Purpose
model.pkl	Portable, loadable model file for use in APIs, testing, or packaging
MLflow log	Tracks experiment metrics and stores versioned model for reproducibility
